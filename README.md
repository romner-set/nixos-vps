Each VPS hosts (so far):
 - a [rathole](https://github.com/rapiz1/rathole) instance for NAT traversal
 - a KnotDNS secondary server for https://cynosure.red

It's also worth noting that the VPSs are considered completely untrusted, so they only proxy already encrypted web traffic at the TCP level and publish records DNSSEC-signed by the trusted main server (to whose hardware I have physical access to).

### Deploying a new VPS
Mostly a personal guide for convenience, should work for anyone trying to use this config though.

1. Boot into an installer using kexec (https://github.com/nix-community/nixos-images), make sure an SSH key is set in `/root/.ssh/authorized_keys`.
   This only works for ARM machines, use the one in the linked README for x86
   ```sh
   curl -L https://github.com/nix-community/nixos-images/releases/download/nixos-unstable/nixos-kexec-installer-noninteractive-aarch64-linux.tar.gz | tar -xzf- -C /root
   /root/kexec/run
   ```
   SSH into the new system afterwards.

2. Format & mount persistent storage, install system
   ```sh
   hostname=REPLACEME
   repo="romner-set/nixos-vps"

   nix --experimental-features "nix-command flakes" run github:nix-community/disko -- --mode disko --flake "github:$repo#$hostname"
   nixos-install --no-root-passwd --flake "github:$repo#$hostname"
   ```
3. Manually create `/mnt/data/rathole.toml` according to this template:
   ```toml
   [server]
   bind_addr = "[::]:444"

   [server.transport]
   type = "noise"
   [server.transport.noise]
   pattern = "Noise_KK_25519_ChaChaPoly_BLAKE2s"
   local_private_key = "REPLACEME" # created with `rathole --genkey`
   remote_public_key = "kAucMFPz3+2RP+LTQ6X/LjBcIlmjQ+r8/vBtKe9NfWM=" # main server's pubkey

   [server.services.doq]
   type = "udp"
   token = "REPLACEME"
   bind_addr = "[::1]:853"
   [server.services.http]
   token = "REPLACEME"
   bind_addr = "[::]:80"
   [server.services.https]
   token = "REPLACEME"
   bind_addr = "[::]:443"
   [server.services.http3]
   type = "udp"
   token = "REPLACEME"
   bind_addr = "[::]:443"
   ```

4. Setup `/data` & reboot
   ```sh
   cd /mnt/data
   chmod 600 rathole.toml # see 3.
   mkdir knot && chown 999:999 knot
   reboot
   ```
5. Update main server, i.e.
   1. Create new rathole keys & client config
   2. Authorize the VPS' `knotc status cert-key`
6. Do something productive (or not) with the time you've just saved
